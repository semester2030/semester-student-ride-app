# Language Switching Test Guide

## How to Test Language Switching

1. **Build and Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Navigate to Language Settings**
   - Open the app
   - Go to Settings (from bottom navigation)
   - Tap on "Change Language" / "تغيير اللغة"

3. **Test Language Switching**
   - Select Arabic to switch to RTL layout
   - Select English to switch back to LTR layout
   - Notice how the entire UI direction changes

4. **Verify RTL Layout**
   When Arabic is selected, check:
   - Text alignment changes to right-to-left
   - Navigation elements flip horizontally
   - Icons and buttons move to appropriate sides
   - Padding and margins adjust correctly

5. **Test Persistence**
   - Change language and restart the app
   - The selected language should persist

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Missing Translations Error**
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

2. **Cache Issues**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```

3. **Check Generated Files**
   Look for `lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart` and related files in the `.dart_tool` directory.
